## 📝 Project Overview

Soni Blissful Events is a professional-grade Sports Club Management System built to modernize and simplify how sports clubs operate. From member registration to court bookings, announcements to payments—Soni Blissful Events provides a fully digitized ecosystem for managing day-to-day club activities with ease and efficiency.

## 🎯 Target Audience

- Sports club admins and managers
- Enthusiasts seeking court/session bookings
- Club members tracking their events and payments

- Transparent and streamlined court management
- Real-time announcements and coupon handling
